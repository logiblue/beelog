## The new era of Google Analytics

Google decided to kill the switch on their Analytics Service pushing all users to migrate their setups on the new version - G4A.
In my case I was in charge of migrating a good amount of WP installations. In this quick quide I'll brief you in parts you should know and other that you should take care.

## How to install the new script.

In this guide I'll follow the script route.

Start by logging into the analytics platform and choose your desired Analytics account from the list.
Under Properties and Apps column you should have one or two items.
Choose the Item with a code starting with "UA - XXXXXXXXX".

TIP: The code starting with UA Means that is the old version called Universal analytics and should be replaced.

Click on Manage GA4 migration and then you should be redirected on this screen

Click on get started button and choose Create and Continue.

This way we keep the old Universal analytics property, copy the basic settings of the UA Property and create a new property with a new TAG.

Give this a moment and wait till the process is completed. After that head to the Data Streams Tab and copy the script from the "**View Tag Instructions**"

Last, Copy this on your website. It's better to keep both the NEW and the OLD script until the new tag will gather enough data.

### What Happens to my old data?

Well, the documentation claims that all your data will be erased along with your old Analytics property. All the information will be available for about 6 Months and then will be removed.
So we have to be proactive on this one.

### What to look for before Migrating?

Keep an eye on the Propery Access Management and Account Access Management.
If this for example is an ecommerce website you should see a bunch of emails in the list. Make sure everything is copied in the new property. Otherwise copy them manualy or by exporting the into a CSV and then transfer them to the new property.
